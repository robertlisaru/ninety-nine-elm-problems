## Description
My solutions to johncrane's [Ninety-nine Problems, Solved in Elm](https://johncrane.gitbooks.io/ninety-nine-elm-problems/content/).

## About Elm
[Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) is a purely functional programming language and a frontend web framework. If you are not used to functional programming, it will be challenging at first. But once you learn and use it for a while, it becomes a pleasure to write code. 
- Most of the bugs reveal themselves at `compile time`.
- No hidden `runtime exceptions` will be breaking your production code.
- Functions have no `side effects`.
- Application `components` are decopled and don't break eachother.
- If you want to make a change, you just do it without the fear of breaking something else, as the `compiler` will guide you through all the code that needs to be updated to accomodate your change without breaking anything else.
- `Error messages` are informative and you immediately know what to do.
- No more `undefined` runtime errors. Everything is always defined.
- `Application flow` is easy to follow in code.
- Elm developers are friendly, helpful, and always excited to talk about Elm.

## My Elm experience <3
- After React, this was the 2nd web framework I had ever interacted with at the time, in 2021.
- At university I had mostly used imperative languages like Java, C, C++, PHP.
- Thinking in a functional style was not easy at first, but shortly became natural and intuitive to me.
- It took me 7 days to learn the Elm basics and build a small test app.
- After that, I jumped straight into a real-world production project, where I successfully deployed over 100 pull requests, and many thousand lines of code.

The elm tree is also a wonderful tree.

## How to run
Run `elm make src/Main.elm` then open `index.html` file locally in your browser.
