## About Elm
[Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) is a purely functional programming language and a frontend web framework. If you are not used to functional programming, it will be challenging at first. But once you learn and use it for a while, it becomes a pleasure to write code. 
- Most of the bugs reveal themselves at `compile time`.
- No hidden `runtime exceptions` will be breaking your production code.
- Functions have no `side effects`.
- Application `components` are decopled and don't break eachother.
- If you want to make a change, you just do it without the fear of breaking something else, as the `compiler` will guide you through all the code that needs to be updated to accomodate your change without breaking anything else.
- `Error messages` are informative and you immediately know what to do.
- No more `undefined` runtime errors. Everything is always defined.
- `Application flow` is easy to follow in code.
- Elm developers are friendly, helpful, and always excited to talk about Elm.

## How to run
Run `elm make src/Main.elm` then open `index.html` file locally in your browser.
